            <p class="info">Hi, my name's Kevyn. I'm 19 years old and currently attending Algonquin College, studying Interactive Media Design. Honestly, I didn't think I'd like coding at first but after completing the first semester, I'm definitely considering venturing into the world of web development once I graduate (heard it pays pretty well too). My favorite hobby is European football. I've been playing since I was really young and have been a fan of the sport even longer. Another hobby I have is drawing, which I have also been doing from a young age. Last but not least, sleeping. If I could get paid for sleeping, I'd be a millionaire.
